# HTTP-From-Scratch

This is a simple HTTP server project built from scratch in the C programming language. The primary goal of this project is to deepen my understanding of web server development, network programming, and the HTTP protocol.

## What is HTTP?

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web. It is an application layer protocol that enables the transfer of resources, such as HTML documents and images, between clients (typically web browsers) and servers.

## Project Overview

This project serves as a personal learning tool for exploring the intricacies of HTTP and web server development. It is not intended for production use and may not adhere to all the best practices required for robust, secure, and scalable web servers. However, it provides a solid foundation for those interested in learning about:

- How HTTP works at a low level.
- Network programming and socket communication.
- Handling HTTP requests and responses.
- Building a basic HTTP server from scratch.
